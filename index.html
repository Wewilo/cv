      <p> <em>Ã–ÄŸrenci ve <strong>CTO AdayÄ±</strong>.</em> </p>
      <p>Tyrell began his career at E Corp as a highly knowledgeable technician, rising up the ranks of the conglomerate and eventually gaining the position of Senior Vice President of Technology. He served as the ambitious right-hand man of Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Terry Colby.</p>
      <p>Wellick is determined to be appointed as the company's official CTO. He works out regularly, prepares a speech recommending his internal promotion, and slaps himself when his performance doesn't meet his own standards. He begins reciting an affirmative mantra: "You will be the next CTO of this company." Tyrell comes tantalizingly close to his meeting with Phillip Price, but the CEO apologizes and promises to reschedule. Crushed, Tyrell struggles to keep a straight face, and instead seeks an exploit: he requests an e-mail from Price's secretary, Anwar Raziz. Afterwards, Wellick dons latex gloves and finds an outlet for his anger, paying $300 to beat a homeless man senseless. </p>
